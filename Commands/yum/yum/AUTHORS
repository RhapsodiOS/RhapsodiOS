YUM AUTHORS
----------------

Yum is currently maintained by Seth Vidal <skvidal@phy.duke.edu>. Yum was
written to scratch an itch for some folks at duke, specifically seth. It was
based in huge parts off of code from yup - the yellowdog updater. Yum has used 
a bunch of code from other gpl'd projects - up2date, anaconda and yup.  Folks below
are thanked for their help/code/smarts.
