Usage:
-----
The driver is automatically loaded during system boot if a floppy controller
is detected. Floppy disks appear as /dev/fd0 and /dev/rfd0 (block and character
devices).

Notes:
-----
- This driver supports up to 4 floppy drives (typical systems have 1 or 2)
- Only 1.44MB high-density disks are currently supported
- Write protection is detected and honored
