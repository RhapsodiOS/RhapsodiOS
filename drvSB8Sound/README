The SoundBlaster8 driver supports 8-bit Sound Blaster series cards. You can get documentation on programming these sound cards from Creative labs Software Development Kit (SDK) or from many public ftp sites.

This driver tries not to rely on commands that are undocumented in the SDK so it should work on many Sound Blaster compatible cards.

The sound library will do a lot of conversions for us while playing data. It will convert stereo to mono and 16-bit linear or 8-bit mulaw format to 8-bit linear if necessary. This support is only available from release 3.3. However there is no sample rate conversion.
